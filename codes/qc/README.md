## qc
Codes relevant to the quality control / data generation steps are in this `qc` directory.
- `rna_qc.py` was used for quality control of mRNA expression matrix
- `protein_qc_plots.py` was used for quality control of protein expression matrix
- `prep_protein_expression_matrix.py` and `prep_protein_expression_matrix.R` was used to prepare the protein expression matrix (e.g. normalization within and across batch)
- `create_ps_and_qs_matrix.py` was used to create mRNA-adjusted protein expression matrix and protein-adjusted mRNA expression matrix
