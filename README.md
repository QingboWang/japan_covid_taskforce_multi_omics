Welcome to the github page for the Statistically and functionally fine-mapped blood e/pQTLs from 1,405 humans reveal their distinct regulation patterns and disease relevance. Nat. Genet. (2024). paper, where we report on a thorough analysis of plasma protein expression and whole blood RNA-seq data from 1,405 genotyped samples from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force.

The scripts used in the paper are stored in the code directory.

The data analysed in the notebook is publicly available at the NBDC Human Database (ID: hum0343.v3).
