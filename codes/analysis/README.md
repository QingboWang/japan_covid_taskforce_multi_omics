- `specificqtls_analysis.py` was used for analysis of mRNA or protein specific QTLs (Fig. 3)
- `classify_proteins.py` was used to analyse proteins in light of blood mRNA expression levels and other classifications (Fig. 3, 6)
- `coloc_analysis.py` was used for colocalization analysis of e/pQTLs (Fig. 3, 4, 7)
- `locuszoom_plots.py` was used to generate locus zoom figures (Fig. 3, 4, 7)
- `trans_qtl_analysis.py` was used for trans-e/pQTL analysis (Fig. 5)
